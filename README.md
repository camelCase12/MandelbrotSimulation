# MandelbrotSimulation
Processing (java based) based simulation of the Mandelbrot set, a famous mathematical set of complex numbers.

The program picks random floating point number based points from (-2, -2) to (2, 2) and determines whether they are within the set down to an accuracy of 1000 iterations of the Mandelbrot set. The program continually adds more points at a chosen rate, usually between 10,000 and 100,000 per second or so.

Mousewheel to zoom in/out, arrow-up to run a full scan (takes several seconds), arrow-down to save the current frame (a few example images are included).
